Though I try to embrace best practices for mutual intelligibility, my bias towards solo/small projects has moulded my coding habits. With each new project I take the opportunity to try out different things (after all, the grass is always greener), so none of this is set in stone. Of course, when working on someone else's project I do my best to adopt and conform to their guidelines instead.
