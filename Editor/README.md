# Code Style

## Indentation

Size 2 tabs. Spaces v Tabs is infamous, but after using both extensively I always come back to tabs for my own projects.

Pros:
- Semantic. Tabs are designed for indentation. It makes sense to let someone change the size they want to view a tab as.
- Searchable. Multiple consecutive spaces are almost always style errors in my code. I want to be able to search for these project-wide instantly.
- Clarity. I style invisible characters as visible when selected in my editor. It's much easier to read the indentation number from tabs than a dot for every space.
- Selecting indentation points. Although many editors offer some support for automatically grouping spaces for selecting/cursor insertion, it almost never does exactly what I expect, and is far from a universal feature. Tabs just work, always.

Cons:
- Standards. Most people in JS-land seem to use spaces. Not much of a reason for personal projects.

## Comments

Comments are essentially warnings in my code, as otherwise I find them to be too distracting when interspersed. I prefer external documentation, although I probably don't do that enough either. One of shortcomings in the code I write.

//TODO Anything that needs fixing/implementing. _Should_ be accompanied by ðŸš§ when commited.

//SAMPLE Code I want to easily search for and toggle for testing purposes. Related lines should always be commented out when committed.
